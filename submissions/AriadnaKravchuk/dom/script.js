        name: "Mae Borowski",
        illustration: "./assets/img/mae.png",
        general: "Margaret Borowski, better known as Mae, is the player character and main protagonist of Night in the Woods. After Mae drops out of college, she comes back to her hometown of Possum Springs, and moves back in with her parents.",
        appearance: 'Mae is a cat with dark blue fur and dyed red hair on the top of her hair, which has since faded into a dark red. She has large red eyes. Her right ear is also notched from a dog attack, and Mae can be seen flicking this ear frequently throughout the game while idle. Her attire consists of an orange shirt with long red sleeves, with a slashed zero design in the center. Mae also has dark grey jeans and wears boots that are described as "cheap green-ish knock-off Doc Martens". Mae is noticeably shorter than others in Possum Springs and considers herself to be overweight. Her grandfather called her "sturdy," an assessment that Mae ultimately agrees with, and worries that her style of clothing accentuates her "roundness".',
        personality: 'Mae Borowski is known to be energetic and agile, enjoying to climb things whenever possible. Her close friends and family (and the police) reference her habits of climbing electrical poles, tightrope walking on the power lines, and general running around and jumping. Mae Borowski has a troubled past, primarily with depression and anger issues. She was instructed, early in her youth, to "repress" these issues by Dr. Hank, something that Mae appears to have taken to heart. Her emotional turmoil is later revealed to be stemmed from a dissociative episode, leading to a violent episode, something that Mae calls the Incident. She can be seen as a disrespectful person, even referring to herself as "a jerk". As the game progresses, her more compassionate side is revealed. One example of this is when she comforting others, especially her friends during emotional moments. She seems to worry about Bruce and appears to genuinely care for her "rat babies" once she discovers them, even stealing pretzels from the pierogi stand in order to feed them. She greatly loves and cares for her friends, and isn\'t afraid to express this. Mae is rather nostalgic and often reminisces about Possum Springs as it was when she left for college, though she often reflects on how much the town has changed since her absence.'

        id: "2",
        name: "Bea Santello",
        illustration: "./assets/img/bea.png",
        general: "Beatrice Santello, or better known as Bea, was Mae's childhood best friend till the Possum Springs. She is a member of the band and plays the drums (on her computer). She is 20 years old, and two months younger than Mae.",
        appearance: 'Bea is a dark teal crocodile with either red (in-game) or dark blue (promotional material) eyes. Three dark-colored, oblong scales are visible on the back of her head. She is often seen with either a lit cigarette in her mouth, or a fake cigarette dummy (like in Bea\'s second hang-out), though not always. Bea dresses in a goth-like manner, wearing entirely black clothing to match her somber personality. Her long black dress displays an Ankh, a hieroglyph meaning "life", on the front and such clothing can also be found in the URevolution store at the Fort Lucenne Mall. She also wears black tights or leggings with black boots.',
        personality: 'Bea has a very gloomy and cold attitude, due to both having gone through numerous unfortunate events in less than two years time, and seeing the slow economic decay of Possum Springs first-hand. She has no patience for jokes or facetiousness and reacts to these with sarcasm or anger depending on her mood. Her heavy smoking habit is likely a coping mechanism for the stresses in her life. In contrast to Mae, Bea is a person quite grounded in reality. Her hardships seem to have made her cynical, her fears are of relatively mundane and practical matters, rather than anything irrational or paranormal. Similarly, her escapism consists mostly of imagining the future she thought she was going to have, but which she has been denied of. Despite her dour outlook on life, Bea possesses a strong sense of responsibility and duty. When her mother died, Bea shelved her dreams in order to look after her father, feeling she has no other choice. She also forced Mae to return stolen merchandise after initially being goaded into committing "crimes" with her, and often feels guilty whenever involved in any potential criminal activity.'

        id: "3",
        name: "Gregg Lee",
        illustration: "./assets/img/gregg.png",
        general: "Greggory Lee, or Gregg, is Mae's best friend and Angus' boyfriend, having known them both in high school. Gregg works down at the Snack Falcon and lives in an apartment in Towne Centre with Angus. Mae can find Gregg most days in Possum Springs working within the Snack Falcon.",
        appearance: 'Gregg is an orange fox with navy eyes and yellow scleras. He has a minor overbite, with two sharp teeth sticking out of his mouth. His attire consists of a black, leather jacket over a dark gray shirt. He also wears blue jeans and navy, "rockabilly-like" boots. Sometimes he likes to sport an old, Prussian Pickelhaube with a bullet hole and an anarchy sticker. He has a tattoo of a sheep on his bicep, inspired by the incident from his childhood. The tattoo holds deep meaning for him, expressing his desire to leave Possum Springs with Angus.',
        personality: 'Gregg is talkative, exuberant, and rebellious. He is a very punk-like character. But despite his loud and optimistic demeanor, Gregg has a fear that he may accidentally ruin his relationship with Angus. It\'s stated by Bea directly that he probably has bipolarity to some degree, and even Gregg himself has mentioned having "really up up days and really down down days". Gregg had also said that most of the time he can\'t tell what kind of day it\'s been until it\'s over. He is also known to be very excitable, frequently expressing said excitement by shouting or flapping his arms rapidly. However, he has also been seen to have poor impulse control. Though he\'s a troublemaker, he cares about his friends and is willing to help them out when they need it. He frequently asks how they\'re doing, and isn\'t afraid to express the fact that he cares about them. He has serious moments as well, and has messaged Mae on occasion telling her that he\'s having a rough day. Gregg has expressed a concern that he\'s not sure if he\'s a good person, as well as a fear that he\'s going to mess up what he and Angus have. He states that he tends to lie awake at night while thinking about what he dislikes about himself.'

        id: "4",
        name: "Angus Delaney",
        illustration: "./assets/img/angus.png",
        general: 'Angus Delaney is a secondary character of Night in the Woods and Gregg\'s boyfriend. He works the day shift at Video Outpost "Too" and shares an apartment with Gregg in Towne Centre. He is first encountered at band practice and will otherwise be found working the counter at Video Outpost "Too". According to Longest Night, his sign is Fish.',
        appearance: "Angus is a large, auburn bear with round, thick-rimmed, black glasses. He wears a dark green sweater over an off-white dress shirt with a black tie. He also wears navy pants, black shoes, and a black fedora.",
        personality: 'Angus is a quiet and polite individual with an interest in science. Bea describes Angus as an "annoyingly strident atheist" and as such, Angus will dismiss the paranormal even when encountering a strange situation. Instead, he prefers an evidence-based approach to almost everything. Compared to most characters, Angus is stoic, shy, and seems rather disconnected from others with the exception of Gregg, though he is deeply concerned about others\' safety and well-being. Bea may remark that Angus is equally a responsible parental figure and boyfriend to Gregg, which she feels is what the latter needs. He is shown to have a good sense of humor when in good company, but can otherwise come off as subdued or joyless. He tends not to let his emotions show, but is rather prone to crying. Angus is also good with computers, to the point where Gregg believes him to be a hacker. He also enjoys cooking to the point where it also functions for him as a coping mechanism in stressful situations. He seems calm enough talking about his past, but some parts of it have clearly stuck with him. He cooks often and likes to bake for other people, due to his mother withholding food from him when he was younger. Angus has mentioned in the supplementary game that even though he is a bear, he does not feel much "Ursidae pride." Angus mentions often feeling like a failure but, is incredibly sensitive about the subject.'
