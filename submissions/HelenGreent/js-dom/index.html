              Plants that produce toxins are referred to as poisonous plants.
              Plants that cause irritation on contact are also described as
              "poisonous". The toxins in poisonous plants affect herbivores, and
              deter them from consuming the plants. Plants cannot move to escape
              their predators, so they must have other means of protecting
              themselves from herbivorous animals. Some plants have physical
              defenses such as thorns, spines and prickles, but by far the most
              common type of protection is chemical.[2] Over millennia, through
              the process of natural selection, plants have evolved the means to
              produce a vast and complicated array of chemical compounds to
              deter herbivores. Tannin, for example, is a defensive compound
              that emerged relatively early in the evolutionary history of
              plants, while more complex molecules such as polyacetylenes are
              found in younger groups of plants such as the Asterales. Many of
              the known plant defense compounds primarily defend against
              consumption by insects, though other animals, including humans,
              that consume such plants may also experience negative effects,
              ranging from mild discomfort to death. More info
