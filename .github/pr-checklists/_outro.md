Universal recommendations:
- Give variables and functions meaningful names. Avoid generic names like `item`, `element`, `key`, `object`, `array` or their variations. Exception: helper functions that are specifically and intentionally designed to be multipurpose.
- Function names should start with a verb as they denote actions; variables are normally nouns; boolean variables/functions start with `is`, `does`, `has` etc; variable containing multiple entities and functions returning lists contain entity name in plural form.
- Have consistent code style and formatting. Employ [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) to do all dirty work for you.
- Use common sense or seek for an advice whenever requirements look ambiguous or unclear. 

Also take a note of the requirements above and follow them in all your future projects.

By the way, you may proceed to the next task before this one is reviewed and merged.
